About: â€œI work in web development, focusing on React and TypeScript. I have constantly sought to evolve as a developer, exploring different tools and technologies, as well as starting a degree in Systems Analysis and Development to strengthen my technical foundation.
My previous experience in design has given me a good understanding of UI/UX, which greatly complements my work with code and helps me create more intuitive and functional solutions.
I am always looking for new challenges, learning opportunities, and chances to transform ideas into digital experiences."
